- Cancel an existing appointment
- View upcoming appointments

## Technologies used
- ReactJS for the frontend
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend
- MySQL for the database

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies by running npm install in the root directory
3. Start the backend server by running npm run server in the root directory
4. Start the frontend by running npm start in the root directory
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the app

## Note
This is a simple project for learning and practising purpose, and it is not intended for production use.
